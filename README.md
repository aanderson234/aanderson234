# Hi there 👋

My name is Alex, and I'm a final-year Biomedical Sciences student at the University of Edinburgh! 🎓

🧬 I've just finished my honours dissertation on avian influenza (H5N1)—exploring how it spreads between birds, poultry, and humans using genomic data and data visualisation.  
💼 I'm currently job hunting and upskilling by teaching myself Python.  
📊 I'm most comfortable in **R**, especially for health data analysis and visual storytelling.  
🌱 I’m passionate about public health, science communication, and using data for impact.  
📫 Reach me at: [s2094647@ed.ac.uk](mailto:s2094647@ed.ac.uk)  
🌊 Fun fact: I love scuba diving!
